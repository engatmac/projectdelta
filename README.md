Lingexchange
A unique way to connect people around the world.
As society moves forward, the world becomes globalized, and bridges are built between nations and culture. Language is an integral part of these bridges' structures. 
However, many people face challenges when trying to learn a new language, an example of this exists for refugees who have immigrated to the West. 
What our program seeks to do is build an interface between refugees and people in the west, where they can exchange contact information over social networks like skype.
